# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
the function takes the external input of the user and runs it through the pre established patterns in the program and retrieves the info if understood. if not it returns to the user that it doesn't understand the input/question

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added puss in boots the last wish 2022 because it is my favorite movie and the best movie ever and i will fight everyone on it. it is te most accurate representation of adopted families and mental health and self growth. as well as the main villian of "death" he only appears for a total of 7 minutes in the film and his presence is felt throughout. quite literally the best movie i have ever seen

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I added "actors of" because humans like simplicity and shortcuts so a tendancy to abreviate questions would seem like a common occurance. It will make to program simpler to use as well as efficient. 

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would create a chatbot bot like this that allow me to make decisions over mundane tasks. Like what to wear or what to eat. In order to reduce the amount of decisions I would have to make throughout the day. 

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
I found it quite difficult with understanding the logic process of what was happening throughout the function making process. I didn't have a firm grasp of what everything was doing like apphend and what the parameters meant in the "get..." functions

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
yes i did
